Helloworld,
i am Sebastian Cramer.

I develop software for a medium sized company that is *not* specialized on software development.
But i still love my craft.

Therefore i created this blog to spread the word.

I like talking about
- technolgies
- workflows
- programattical approaches
- philosophical topics

Therefore this blog will contain a mixed bag of hopefully smart bits.

> This blog contains my opinions that formed due to my experiences.
> They may be different from yours and that's okay.
> 
> Take everthing with a grain of salt and have your own opinions.
> Nothing of this needs to have an influence on your life, but if it has, i hope it's good.
