Everybody is rambling about AI. I want some cake, too.
I think it's a great technology, but there are a few things to keep in mind.

Currently there are multiple types of AI users in my immediate vicinity

## The Manager

It's an old story. Tech comes, it's trendy, everybody talks about this.
Management is more subsceptible than a dog that smells treats.
The current situation is that many people in management want to adopt AI.
They just don't know _what_ they want to do with it.
It's use AI for the sake of AI, it saves time after all, no?

## The User

Not much different from the manager, but less ability to do executive damage.
Users complain about AI because it does not do what they want.
Prompts are typically as precise as this
> find booking errors in this 100k row excel file

## The graybeard dev

I am still trying to find a correlation between lifestyle, health, age and willingness to learn new things in development.
Some people, often from the ages of `<marquee />` are strict against AI and find the wildest reasons for that.
> It's not perfect, it will make errors
> It steals data
> We will all lose our jobs
While there is some - but not much - substance to some of these, most of these people seem not willing to learn new things.
Not just AI.

## The blind optimist

Often times from the younger generations and with less expertise in their field.
If they already own a field.
This species uses AI for everything because there is no other way.
Fast initial success, complete failure in more complex scenarios or edge cases.

## Me
Cautious optimist? Indifferent researcher?
You can give me a more fitting title.<br><br>

I believe AI in development is a great thing.<br>
I believe AI in end user space is good in some areas.<br>
I believe AI in enterprise user space is 80% bad.<br><br>

A little bit like Excel. It's a great tool but let people free roam and 5 Minutes later you
have a full fledged sheet-based shadow IT.

AI in dev has come to stay. 
It's a great tool if the code base has a good structure.
Encapsulated functionalities are good examples of low-hanging AI fruit.
Green-field projects, too.

Complex monolith applications that grew with the cancer-like structures of business structures? Meh.

To identify these uses cases you need _experience_.
If you are going to use AI in a productive enterprise... use the power of your experts.

Maybe one day you won't need them, but experience has shown that these things take a looong time.

> BTW, don't give me the "get rid of the boring stuff, focus on what you love doing.
> I love coding, just sell your AI, don't give me this marketing crap...

I will write more specifics on this topic in the future. 
For now, thanks for listening to my philosophy talk.
